Aho-Corasick (AC): An efficient string-searching algorithm for finding multiple patterns in a text simultaneously. It builds a state machine from all the patterns and processes the input text in a single pass.

Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP): A string-matching algorithm that pre-processes the pattern to avoid redundant comparisons, improving the search time for patterns in text.

Rabin-Karp: Uses hashing to find any one of a set of pattern strings in a text. It is especially effective for detecting plagiarism or finding multiple pattern matches.

Simple Sieve of Eratosthenes: A classical algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to a specified integer. It iteratively marks the multiples of each prime starting from 2.

Segment Tree: A data structure used to store information about intervals or segments. It allows querying and updating intervals efficiently, used in range query problems.

Disjoint Set Union (Union-Find): A data structure that tracks a set of elements partitioned into disjoint (non-overlapping) sets, often used to detect cycles in a graph or in network connectivity problems.
